    <p> Welcome to my website! It's very simple, since I'm just at the start of my coding journey. It's mostly HTML,
        three pages of it in fact, with some CSS sprinkled on top, (like this nice blue background that I found here:
        <a href="https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/named-colors-and-hex-equivalents/" target="_blank"> CSS Colors</a>)
        and just a dash of Javascript, the programming language I'm learning!
        You can find said JavaScript, and a nice little message, under the developer tools option in Chrome.
        I primarily use Opera but I'm not sure where that option is on Opera.
