        For the record, I hate getting asked the "can you describe yourself?" question. I either think of
        everything all  at once or nothing, like my brain is spitting out an error message. I suppose that's either the
        anxiety or ADHD? Either way, I have a hyperactive mind and that usually manifests itself for me in 
        the form of writing. I've enjoyed writing fanfiction, and the occasional original ficiton, ever since
        I was eleven. So as you can imagine, I spend quite a lot of time typing away at a computer already. 
        That's not why I got into coding however. A combination of a small but genuine curiosity in what it's 
        like, my dad currently working in the field, a desire to further my career, and maybe the slight influence
        of the sixth Yugioh series, Yugioh VRAINS, a show where all the characters are programmers/hackers and 
        everything is done through technology, pushed me into paying for this 12 week bootcamp. So now here I am.
        I'm clueless, struggle to focus, a touch sleep deprived, but determined to push through and learn.

        If you're wondering, yes, I do post my fanfictions online, that's part of the fun of it, but no,
        I'm not going to say where. Not because of insecurity, but just because I don't want to. Pretty much
        all of it nowadays is Yugioh stuff anyways because I have a serious problem and watched over a thousand 
        episodes of a series about kids/teens playing a magic card game to save the world. They just kept
        making spin offs and I kept enjoying them so I saw no reason to stop. It's even still going, I watch 
        the new episodes every week. I also play the game on occasion as well as draw so those three hobbies
        are the main things I spend my time on when I'm not in class.
